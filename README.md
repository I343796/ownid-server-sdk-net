## Description
OwnID enables your customers to use their phone as a key to instantly login to your websites or apps. Passwords are finally gone.

This component is the server SDK that you can use to integrate with your Identity Management System. The project include integration to SAP CDC (Gigya). UI integration is using project [ownid-web-ui-sdk](https://github.com/SAP/ownid-web-ui-sdk). 

Evaluation is possible even without any back-end implementation. You can follow the developer-tutorial to set your environment. This is using OwnID back-end that already include the SAP CDC (Gigya) integration.
